Week 11 Journal Entry

Learning activities
This week we continued working on the presentation for our assignment where we filmed ourselves demonstrating the design and functionality of our website. Outside of the group work, I had to write my CP3402 self-reflection for the semester and upload it to LinkedIn. I had to ensure I met all the requirements for the self-reflection and write it to directly-impress any potential website developer employers. To have it appear professional for the website developer employers, I had to include major topics like areas I improved in, and any challenges I faced and how I overcame them.

Estimated Hours
I spent about 4 hours of my own time this week which consisted of: 1 hour on recording, 1 hour on writing the self-reflection, and 2 hours helping the team with putting the presentation together.

Content Insights
Recording the presentation this week was a great opportunity for my team and I to reflect on our time together and the relationships we created along the way. By going over the website we created and filming our analysis and descriptions of the website, was a great way to recognize all parts we contributed to. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this weekâ€™s work, it has been a good experience to bring the team together and continue their resilience even through the last lap of the work. I had to ensure my team and I continued to focus on the task and kept working our hardest, instead of slacking off during the last week of work. After each session with my team, I took about 5 minutes to reflect back on the entire conversation and hypothesized what I could say next time to certain questions or topics with the team to ensure everyone stays focused and resilient.

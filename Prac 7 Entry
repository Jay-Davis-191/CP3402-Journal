Practical 7

Description
This week, I had to demonstrate my PHP skills by creating a login forum that only grants access if the correct username and password is given.

Feelings:
I was bit anxious about this prac as I haven't had much experience in php, but I was excited to learn about it. Once the prac was completed, I was happy with the result. 

Evaluation:
The first impressions of creating the login forum was a bit alarming but after a few hours of research, I became more comfortable with php. 
 
Analuysis:
I believe I have met all requirements, but if I could do more for this prac, I would focus more on design after enhancing the functionality.

Conclusion:
For this prac, I believe more extensive research would greatly help me with my php skills.  

Action plan:
For future pracs like this, I will focus on applying security enhancements if it uses a local or cloud SQL connection. The credentials for my prac were set locally in a different php file.

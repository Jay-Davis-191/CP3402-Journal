Practical 5

Description
This week, I had to create a child theme for my newest website and implement it. Using the child theme, I had to incorporate 6 visible changes to the templates. 

Feelings:
I thought the initial setup for the child theme was a bit confusing but after the correct guide, I thought it was easy to create. The modification of the template felt relatively easy. 

Evaluation:
Trying to apply a particular template to all pages was quite difficult for me.
A good experience of this practical using assigning a different style to the website to give it a fresher look. 
 
Analuysis:
I believe the template application to all pages failed because the required files weren't created for the child theme. 

Conclusion:
For this particular practical, I believe a bit more research and experience into child themes will greatly help me with the difficulties I faced. 

Action plan:
To deal with future practicals like this, I will do more research into child themes and make sure I create all required files for the child theme directory.

Estimated Hours
I spent roughly 1 hour creating the website, 1 hour setting up the host, and 3 hours of troubleshooting. 

Content Insights
I struggled to find out how to integrate/install Joomla with Hostinger but once it was installed, I thought it wasn't too difficult to create the website with Joomla. After tons of research, I was able to find out how to install Joomla. Luckily, the hosting provider comes with its own auto-installer. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After finishing this prac, I started the next practical and looked into setting up WordPress. Luckily, the host provider has its own auto-installer so it should install WordPress easily.
